title: Welcome to SFAC
---
<p>
This is the website of UC San Diego's Student Fee Advisory Committee,
commonly just called SFAC.
</p>
<p>
Every campus in the University of California system has a body equivalent to our SFAC.
There are only two mandatory system-wide fees: tuition (formerly Education Fee),
and the Student Services Fee.
The purpose of each SFAC is to oversee the use of the latter on its campus,
and to ensure its use adheres to applicable <a href="http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/policies/3101.html">Regental Policy</a> and
<a href="http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/coordrev/policy/guidelines_studentfee.pdf">Presidential Guidelines</a>.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, our committee is empowered to make recommendations on the use of all students fees,
and will frequently weigh in on new referenda fees prior to voting.
We are also a member of the system-wide <a href="http://ucsa.org/section/view/csf">Council on Student Fees</a>,
an affiliate of the <a href="http://ucsa.org/">UC Student Association</a> and a regentally-recognized system-wide advisory board on matters regarding student fees.
